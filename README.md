## Step 1
Write a program to identify fruits. The fruit can by identified by color, form and size

Example: 

> - green, cylindric, small => kiwi
> - red, diamond, small => strawberry
> - yellow, round, small => lemon
> - yellow, long, medium => banana
> - yellow, round, big => melon

## Step 2

Refactor that identification logic to use a Strategy Design Pattern.
